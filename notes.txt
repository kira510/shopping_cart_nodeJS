Express js is all about middleware.
These are the steps between req and response.


How to use express.js
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('in middleware');
    next(); //takes to next app.use callback function
});


This is the app that needs to be passed into http.createServer(app);


app.get --> same as app.use
app.post, put, patch, delete can be used to filter the type of method

note that: use will not do an exact match but get, post will do



Express concepts: All about middleware
1. importing and creating a server
2. adding and managing different routes using app.use
3. difference between app.get and app.use
4. using the body parser
5. using the express Router, express.Router
6. Adding an error page for /skndks
7. All routes have same satrting can be split where there are registered,
   eg: app.use('/admin', adminRoutes);
8. Using path to add html pages to the route
9. Adding a utility path method path.dirname(process.mainModule.filename);
10. Serving static files using app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));



Path.join
This has to be used to contruct the path instead of using / or \ cause This
detects the operation system and creates the path acordingly hence works on
windows, linux and mac.
__dirname gives the current directory.
